(define cards
  (list 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 'Jack 'Queen 'King 'Ace 2 'Black 'Red))

;; (card? val) consumes any value and produces true if the value is a valid Card; false otherwise

;; Examples:

(check-expect (card? 'Jack) true)
(check-expect (card? "3") false)

;; card?: Any -> Bool

(define (card? val)
  (cond
    [(member? val cards) true]
    [else false]))

;; Tests:

(check-expect (card? 'Spade) false)
(check-expect (card? 5) true)
