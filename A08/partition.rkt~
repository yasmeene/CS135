;; (partition pred lst) consumes a predicate and a list and produces a two element list where the
;; first element is a list of items that satisfy the predicate and the second element is a list of
;; items that dont

;; Example:

(check-expect (partition string? (list "banana" "apple" 'cs135 "blue" 135))
              (list (list "banana" "apple" "blue") (list 'cs135 135)))

;; partition: (Any -> Bool) (listof Any) -> (listof Any) (listof Any)

(define (partition pred lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? lst) empty]
    [(pred (first lst)) (list (first lst) (partition pred (rest lst)))]
    [else (list (first lst) (partition pred (rest lst)))]))
