;; (tree-pred pred) consumes a one-argument predicate and produces a function that consumes a binary
;; tree and produces true if the predicate is valid for every value in the tree, false othwerwise.

;; Examples:

(check-expect ((tree-pred even?) t) false)
(check-expect ((tree-pred positive?) t) true)

;; tree-pred: (Nat -> Bool) -> Bool
