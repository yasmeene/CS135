(define-struct node (key left right))

;; A Node is a (make-node Nat BST BST)
;; requires: key > every key in left BST
;;           key < every key in right BST


;; A Binary Search Tree (BST) is one of:
;; * empty
;; * Node


;;~~~~ 3a

;; (full? bst) consumes a binary search tree and produces true iff
;; the given binary search tree is full

;; Examples:

(check-expect (full? empty) true)
(check-expect (full? (make-node 5
                                (make-node 1 empty empty)
                                (make-node 7
                                           (make-node 6 empty empty)
                                           (make-node 14 empty empty)))) true)
