;; (contains-component? comp name) consumes a component and a name and produces
;; true if the component or one of its subcomponents has the given name and false otherwise

;; Examples:

(check-expect (contains-component? bike "hub") true)
(check-expect (contains-component? bike "brake") false)

;; contains-component?: Component Str -> Bool
